# The language purpose

Meta programming differently.

Meta programming is creating programs writing programs.
Lisp-style meta-programming allows for building building
language constructs and executing them. We, on the other hand,
will focus on building programs in "external" languages.
This means, that there will be a difference between language,
which writes and the target langauge.
