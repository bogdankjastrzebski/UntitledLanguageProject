# The basic proposition is this:
# If we can prove, that if 
# * t1(a) (is equal to true)
# then  
# * t2(f(a)) 
# Then we have a type theory.

string?(x) : true if x isa String else False

let foo(x string?) string?
	return ... 

# That means, that we should be able to prove, that
# if the entry is a string, the output is a string.
