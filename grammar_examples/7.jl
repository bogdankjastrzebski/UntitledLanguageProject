# To sum up
# internally there are c-like structs and primitive types, which are not typed.
# Later, we usually use TypedObject struct, which contains label and data.
# c-like struct is a primitive struct
# There are two different type types: (abstract) types and structs
# We can dispatch on types, which are equivalent to abstract types
# We cannot dispatch on structs. This functionality is hidden. 
# There are, however, several functions that automatically work for some structs, 
# for instance setters, getters, which obey the multiple dispatch.
